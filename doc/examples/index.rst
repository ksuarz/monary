Examples
========

This sections gives examples of accomplishing specific tasks with Monary.

Unless otherwise noted, all examples assume that the MongoDB daemon is running
on the default host and port. If MongoDB is already `downloaded and installed
<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Getting+Started>`_ on the system, it can be
started by issuing the following in a shell::

    $ mongod

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    query
    block-query
    insert
    binary
    string
    timestamp
